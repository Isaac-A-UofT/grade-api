#Description
We will be building an online marketplace exclusively for uoft students. Users will be required to use a uoft email to register and we will use ______ email verification api to ensure users do not make fake emails.

The online marketplace will give users a platform to buy and sell items.

Users will be able to post items for sale and remove the items once sold.

Buyers can message the sellers.

#What we will use to make this work

We will host the website using AWS

We will use AWS cognito to manage login and signup information

We will use AWS S3, to store the information on items for sale

We will use AWS lambda and the AWS lambda api as a means for the users to interact with the front and back end
